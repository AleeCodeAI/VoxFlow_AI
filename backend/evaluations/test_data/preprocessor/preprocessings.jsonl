I've had it for about 40 years. It started when I was 12 years old. My school had a swimming pool with changing rooms in an old building nearby. On my first day, our teacher warned us about bats inside. She told us not to move much to avoid disturbing them and not to turn the lights on to keep them sleeping. We had to change quickly and quietly. Did a bat ever fly into your hair? No, but the thought terrified me. Does it affect your life? Yes, I feel nervous at dusk when bats appear. If I'm sitting outside in the evening, I keep a tennis racket nearby for protection. I can't watch documentaries about bats or even view photos of them. 2. Do you have any phobias? Yes, I experience severe claustrophobia. How long have you had this phobia? It began about ten years ago while commuting. On a crowded train, I imagined being trapped during an accident. I had a panic attack with rapid heartbeat and had to exit the train. How does this affect your life? I avoid crowded trains and subways due to fears of tunnel entrapment. I also minimize elevator use and always request aisle seats when flying. 3. Do you have any phobias? Yes, I have an unusual fear of clowns. Clowns? Really? How long have you had this? Since childhood. How did it start? At age six or seven during a circus school trip when I encountered clowns. I thought they were silly, but I wasn't afraid of them. Then I attended a birthday party where clowns demonstrated face painting. I disliked being near them. Initially, I merely disliked them, but this dislike gradually evolved into fear. Does your phobia affect your life? No, because I rarely encounter clowns.","timestamp":"2026-01-24 13:03:07"}

Before the late 1950s, American girls primarily played with baby dolls, which typically confined their imaginations to mother or caregiver roles. Around that time, Ruth Handler observed her preteen daughter engaging with paper dolls, assigning them adult occupations like actresses or secretaries. During a European trip, Handler encountered an adult-figure doll in Germany and imported several to the U.S. She envisioned girls expanding their imaginative play through adult-proportioned dolls. Collaborating with engineer Jack Ryan, she redesigned the doll for American consumers, naming it Barbie after her daughter Barbara. Launched in 1959, the first Barbie dolls sold 350,000 units within their debut year. The doll maintains global popularity today, with billions sold since its introduction. Manufacturer Mattel Inc. indicates 90% of American girls aged 3–10 have owned a Barbie. The Chrysler Building. Completed in 1930, this structure remains an enduring New York City landmark. Architect William Van Alen created the Art Deco skyscraper for Walter P. Chrysler, founder of Chrysler Corporation. Van Alen incorporated decorative elements inspired by Chrysler automotive components—the 31st floor's external ornaments replicate 1929 engine parts. Widely regarded as a premier example of Art Deco architecture in America, the Chrysler Building earned recognition as New York City's favorite structure in a 2005 Skyscraper Museum poll. It frequently appears in films and television shows shot in New York. The Love Sculpture. In 1965, artist Robert Indiana conceived a painting centered on the word \"LOVE,\" breaking it into two stacked sections with \"LO\" positioned above \"VE.\" By tilting the \"O\" slightly, he created an iconic American design. The artwork's popularity prompted the Museum of Modern Art and United States Postal Service to commission Indiana for greeting card and stamp adaptations. During the early 1970s, Indiana produced multiple LOVE sculptures for urban installations, with the initial piece positioned at New York City's 6th Avenue and 55th Street intersection. This initiative expanded internationally with installations in New Orleans, Philadelphia, Vancouver, Tokyo, Singapore, among others. Indiana received limited financial benefit from these creations, having neither signed his works nor secured copyright protections against widespread reproductions. Air Jordan Sneakers. Nike designer Peter Moore developed custom red-and-black basketball footwear for Chicago Bulls rookie Michael Jordan in 1984. Marketed as Air Jordan Ones, their color scheme violated NBA uniform regulations, resulting in $5,000 fines per game worn. Despite initial controversy, the sneaker line became extraordinarily profitable. Nike has produced new Air Jordan editions annually since 1985, with designer Tinker Hatfield assuming creative leadership in 1987. Hatfield implemented the Jumpman logo—a silhouetted image of Jordan mid-dunk—and marked the line's 25th anniversary in 2010 with the Jordan 2010 model.","timestamp":"2026-01-24 13:05:17"}

{"id":"dc6adcad-8851-4adf-a6e2-d7efa745ffc6","name":"test6.aac","preprocessed_transcription":"The DeepMind paper demonstrated that hallucinations can be mitigated through two techniques. The first technique involves reinforcement learning, where the model differentiates between user-provided prompts (termed observations in reinforcement learning) and model-generated tokens (termed actions). The second technique employs supervised learning using factual and counterfactual training data signals. One hypothesis suggests hallucinations stem from the mismatch between the model's internal knowledge and labelers' internal knowledge. This view was originally proposed by Leo Gao, an OpenAI researcher. During supervised fine-tuning, models learn to mimic labelers' responses. If these responses rely on knowledge possessed by labelers but not the model, this effectively trains the model to hallucinate.","timestamp":"2026-01-24 13:06:36"}
{"id":"2be28f93-81a2-43b4-b2f2-87a96e54110d","name":"test7.wma","preprocessed_transcription":"AI models sample responses probabilistically. Consider this example illustrating probabilistic behavior: If you ask about the world's best cuisine, human responses typically remain consistent when repeated. However, an AI model might answer differently each time. When Vietnamese cuisine has a 70% probability rating and Italian 30%, the model will select Vietnamese cuisine 70% of the time and Italian 30% of the time. This contrasts with deterministic systems where outcomes are predictable without randomness. The probabilistic nature can lead to inconsistency and hallucinations. Inconsistency occurs when models generate substantially different responses to identical or similar inputs. Hallucination happens when models produce factually ungrounded responses. For instance, if training data included an essay falsely claiming all US presidents are aliens, the model might probabilistically assert the current president is extraterrestrial. From a factual perspective, this constitutes fabrication.","timestamp":"2026-01-24 13:07:03"}

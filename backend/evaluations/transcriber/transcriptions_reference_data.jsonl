{"name":"test1.m4a","transcription":"4.20 1 Do you have any phobias? Yes, I'm terrified of bats. Really? How long have you had the phobia? I've had it for about 40 years, since I was 12 years old. At my school, we had a swimming pool, and the changing rooms were in an old building near the pool. On the first day at school, our teacher told us that there were bats in there and that we shouldn't move around too much because they might start flying around and get into our hair. She also said we shouldn't turn the lights on because this would wake up the bats. We had to change as quickly and quietly as possible. Did a bat ever fly into your hair? No, nothing ever happened, but I was terrified just at the thought of it. Does it affect your life at all? Yes, I often feel very nervous or start to panic if I'm outside when it's beginning to get dark, which is when bats appear. If I'm sitting in my yard in the evening, I always have a tennis racket, so if a bat flies near me, I can protect myself. And I can't watch a TV documentary about bats, or even look at them in photos. 2 Do you have any phobias? Yes, I get very bad claustrophobia. How long have you had the phobia? It just started one morning about 10 years ago. I was going to work on the train, and it was very crowded. I started thinking that if there were an accident, I'd never get out. I had a panic attack, and I sort of felt my heart beating very quickly. I had to get off the train. How does your phobia affect your life? Well, I can't travel on crowded trains. I never ever travel on the subway, because my worst nightmare would be if the train stopped in the tunnel. I also try to avoid elevators. What else? Oh, yes, if I'm flying, I have to have an aisle seat. I can't sit by the window. 3 Do you have any phobias? Yes, I have a pretty unusual phobia. I'm scared of clowns. Clowns? Really? How long have you had it? I've had it for a long time, since I was a child. How did it start? Well, I remember I went on a school trip to the circus when I was six or seven years old, and there were clowns. I thought they were sort of stupid, but I wasn't really afraid of them. Then I went to a birthday party and there were clowns, and they were showing us how to paint our faces. And I found I didn't like being near them. At first I just didn't like them, but over the years my feelings have changed to fear. Does your phobia affect your life at all? Not really, because luckily, I don't see clowns very often."}

{"name":"test3.wav","transcription":"5.31 Barbie. Until the late 1950s, most American girls played with baby dolls, which often limited their imaginations to mother or caregiver roles. At around the same time, Ruth Handler noticed that her preteen daughter was playing with paper dolls, giving them adult roles such as actresses or secretaries. On a trip to Europe, Ruth saw an adult figure doll in Germany and brought several of them back to the US. Handler had the idea that girls could expand their imagination and play acting roles with a doll that looked like an adult. So she and engineer Jack Ryan redesigned the doll for the US market and called her Barbie, after Ruth's daughter, Barbara. The first Barbie dolls were produced in 1959 and sold over 350,000 in the first year. Barbie is still popular today, and billions have been sold around the world since 1959. Mattel Inc, the company that produces Barbie, reports that 90% of American girls between the ages of 3 and 10 have a Barbie doll. The Chrysler Building. The Chrysler Building has been one of the most iconic New York City landmarks since it was completed in 1930. Architect William Van Alen designed the Art Deco building for Walter P. Chrysler, who owned the automobile company, Chrysler Corporation. In fact, Van Alen modeled many of the building's decorative features using Chrysler car parts as inspiration. For example, the decorations on the outside of the building for the 31st floor are fashioned after engine parts from a 1929 Chrysler car. Today, the Chrysler building is still considered one of the best examples of Art Deco architecture in the US. In fact, it was voted New York City's favorite building in 2005 by Skyscraper Museum. In addition, the building appears regularly in movies and TV shows that film in New York City. The Love Sculpture. In 1965, artist Robert Indiana had an idea for a painting with the word Love as the main focus. He decided to break the word up into two lines, putting the LO on top of the VE. He then tilted the O a little, and an iconic American design was born. In fact, it became so popular that the Museum of Modern Art and the United States Postal Service asked Indiana to create versions of his Love painting for cards and stamps. In the early 1970s, Indiana made a series of Love sculptures for display in public parks. The first of these Love sculptures was placed in New York City, on the corner of 6th Avenue and 55th Street. Additional Love sculptures were placed in New Orleans, Philadelphia, Vancouver, Tokyo, and Singapore, as well as many other cities. Unfortunately, Indiana didn't make much money from his Love paintings and sculptures. He never signed his paintings or applied for copyright, so he didn't have legal protection against the many imitations of his work. Air Jordan sneakers. When Michael Jordan started playing basketball for the Chicago Bulls in 1984, he had special Nike sneakers designed for him by Peter Moore. These sneakers were called the Air Jordan 1, or more simply, Air Jordans. They were red and black, the Chicago Bulls colors. Because the sneakers didn't have any white on them, Jordan was fined $5,000 by the National Basketball Association each time he wore them for a game. Every year since then, Nike has created a new pair of Air Jordans to sell. In 1987, Tinker Hatfield took over the design responsibilities for these sneakers, and he has been associated with them ever since. Hatfield introduced the Jumpman logo on the sneakers, which is a silhouette of Michael Jordan dunking a basketball with his legs spread wide. In 2010, Hatfield designed the Jordan 2010s to celebrate the sneaker's 25th anniversary."}

{"name":"test6.aac","transcription":"Okay, so I'm gonna tell you about a, you know, research paper. The DeepMind paper actually showed us that hallucinations can be mitigated by two techniques. The first technique in here, it was written—the first technique comes from reinforcement learning, I guess, in which the model is made to differentiate between user-provided prompts (they might be also called observations about the—which is actually called observations about the world in reinforcement learning) and tokens generated by the model called the model's actions. The second technique leans on supervised learning, in which factual and counterfactual signals are included in the training data. Some people, well, the second hypothesis is that hallucination is caused by the mismatch between the model's internal knowledge and the labeler's internal knowledge. This view was first argued by Leo Gao, who was—wait a minute, I guess he was an OpenAI researcher. So well, building SFT models are trained to mimic responses written by labelers. If these responses use the knowledge that the labelers have but the model doesn't have, we're effectively teaching the model to hallucinate."}
{"name": "test7.wma", "transcription": "The way AI models sample the responses makes them probabilistic. I simply mean like, let's go over an example to see what being probabilistic means. Like, imagine that you want to know what is the best cuisine in the world. If you ask your friend this question twice, a minute apart, maybe your friend's answer might be a little bit, you know, both times should be the same. If you ask an AI model the same question twice, its answer can change. If an AI model thinks that Vietnamese cuisine has a 70% chance of being the best cuisine in the world and Italian cuisine has a 30% chance, it will answer Vietnamese cuisine 70% of the times and Italian cuisine 30% of the time. And the opposite, I mean like, the opposite of the probabilistic is deterministic. When the outcome can be determined without any random variations. Well, this probabilistic nature can call inconsistency and hallucinations. From inconsistency, I simply mean like, inconsistency is when a model generates a very different responses over the same or slightly different problems. Well, on the other, on the other side, hallucination is when a model gives a response that isn't grounded in facts. Imagine if someone on the internet wrote an essay about how all US presidents are aliens. And this essay was included in the training data. The model later will probabilistically output the current US president is an alien. And also, from the perspective of someone who doesn't believe that US presidents are aliens, the model is making this up."}

Ensuring transcription accuracy is critical, as inaccurate results cause user confusion. The first implementation step involves real-time audio capture, potentially using a microphone API, followed by feeding this data into the processing pipeline. For speech-to-text conversion, we should consider OpenAI's Whisper model due to its strong performance and multilingual support - essential for international accessibility. After transcription, preprocessing becomes vital. This involves removing filler words, fixing grammar and punctuation, and combining sentence fragments caused by pauses. Equally important is preserving crucial details like numbers, technical terms, and names to maintain data integrity. Regarding lengthy audio sessions, we must implement context-aware text chunking. Feeding preceding chunks to the preprocessing system ensures logical flow when sentences reference earlier content. This will help maintain coherence and preserve meaning. If we process only individual segments, ambiguities may arise when referring to pronouns like 'he' or 'she' from previous context. Maintaining this contextual window proves crucial for final quality. Regarding the interface, users should be able to either upload audio files or record live audio, with processing occurring in real-time. Displaying real-time transcription updates during processing would enhance the user experience. The backend must manage parallel processing of multiple chunks sent to the LLM simultaneously, while avoiding system overload since the model can be computationally intensive, especially on CPU.

{"id":"269c7e72-66db-4567-8444-7dab64c5b9a8","name":"Running-local-ai","preprocessed_transcription":"I'm running Claude code now to build a full AI application without encountering any rate limits. While others face API throttling, I'm running unlimited coding sessions on my hardware using Claude Code Router. Today we're building an AI PDF chat application to demonstrate this capability. Users can upload any PDF, ask questions, and get instant answers - all running locally. Notably, the same AI model helping me code this application will power it. The AI will effectively build its own interface. By the end, you'll see what's possible without rate limit constraints. My local model is running with Claude Code Router connected. Let's begin coding. We're using CCR code to launch Claude Code through my local AI model in LM Studio. I'm using Coin 3 for both coding the application and enabling PDF questioning functionality. The system is accessible via a local URL, enabling unlimited Claude Code usage with local models. We'll start by passing a prepared initial prompt to Claude Code that outlines the project specifications and requirements. Clear guidance remains essential regardless of AI capability. Claude Code will read this file and create a spec file with tasks to develop the MVP. Then I'll use shift+tab to switch into plan mode. Now you can see that my GPU is fully utilized as it generates the answer. While this occurs, I'll discuss my development environment. Observe that while working through bash commands like ls, I'm using the Windows Subsystem for Linux running Ubuntu. This provides access to a proper bash shell environment, which proves essential since AI code agents typically default to bash over alternatives like PowerShell. Additionally, I'm using a more unleashed version of Claude Code that bypasses command approvals, significantly accelerating the coding process. This approach remains secure within the isolated Windows Subsystem for Linux environment. The system has now generated our specification file, establishing the necessary folder structure and components including API routes for the integration. This initial setup appears satisfactory. Having approved the initial command execution, I'll now transition to the unrestricted Claude Code mode to eliminate repetitive approvals during application implementation. This workflow enhancement maintains security while maximizing efficiency. Bypassing approvals through Claude Code Unleashed addresses the initial prompt since the specification file appears sufficient. I proceed by executing CCR code while bypassing permissions, which triggers a security warning about unrestricted command execution. This is acceptable within the controlled environment. The process autonomously generates the PDF local folder and creates a Node.js project from scratch. While it employs a slightly outdated approach for Next.js implementation, this is typical behavior for AI agents. Engineers add value by subsequently updating dependencies and refining the scaffolded code. The system has now completed the AI integration component, implementing fetch requests to my previously mentioned API endpoint. After this phase, package.json creation includes a dev command. Although initially unformatted, this is easily rectified through Visual Studio Code's auto-formatting capability upon saving. Execution appears near completion as Claude Code attempts to build the application. The process is halted to evaluate the project's current state through local execution. Escape terminates execution for manual debugging. A new terminal opens in the existing PDF-local folder, where 'npm run dev' initiates. The resulting 404 error likely relates to routing configuration given the page structure. The root page exists in the project files but remains inaccessible via root URL. Claude Code is engaged to investigate this routing anomaly alongside the running dev server. While the AI processes the request, development context shifts to mention an AI-native engineering community platform. This resource provides accelerated learning for engineers at all career stages and entrepreneurs building AI systems, expanding beyond the current demonstration's scope. Definitely explore our link in the description below. An evident limitation emerges where attempts to resolve routing issues through local AI prove unsuccessful, prompting a switch to cloud-based Claude. Cloud Claude immediately demonstrates superior capability by precisely identifying Next.js 13+ routing requirements for both homepage and API routes without confusion. This enables swift directory adjustments to resolve the routing configuration. The process required approximately 15-20 minutes of adjusting Claude's output, illustrating effective human-AI collaboration. The fully functional PDF-local reader application now operates locally, defaulting to loading the Pro Git book. Testing confirms successful page navigation and contextual queries. When asking about authorship on page two, the system injects relevant text content into the AI model context, correctly attributing the work to Scott and Ben based on the page content. This page addresses unstaging files using git restore. This concept appears complex. While recording this demonstration while reviewing this material leaves limited time for full comprehension, we will request an AI assistant to summarize the content for Git beginners. The assistant responds by explaining undoing changes in Git, specifically highlighting git restore command introduced in version 2.23.0, which replaced older commands. When possible, entire document contexts can be injected into the AI system memory. Asking \"Where can I find information about git status?\" initially produces an error. LM Studio developer logs reveal the issue: the request contains over 200,000 tokens, exceeding the current Quen 3 deployment's 50,000 token limit. To resolve this, the Quen 7B parameter model must be loaded with a 250,000 token context window. After reloading with expanded capacity, repeating the git status query now processes successfully in LM Studio, observable through API request acceptance. Task Manager monitoring confirms substantial GPU utilization increases during generation, though response times lengthen considerably. Ultimately, the system identifies page 28 as containing git status documentation, though UI adjustments remain necessary for optimal navigation. Page 22 contains the relevant content, though the printed book's pagination differs slightly from the PDF version. Correct navigation requires advancing several pages to locate footer-indicated page 28. This section definitively explains git status functionality. Page 31 further documents advanced command usage scenarios. The core issue emerges when attempting to load extensive technical manuals directly into GPU memory - impractical for hundred-page documents. Effective implementation requires document segmentation and vector embedding generation. Previous tutorials detail these techniques comprehensively. For establishing comparable local AI development environments, consult the description links containing masterclass installation walkthroughs. Deeper learning occurs through participation in our AI-native engineering community, which accelerates practical implementation strategies for contemporary AI tooling.","timestamp":"2026-01-14 09:14:43"}
{"id":"b39c6b43-45b0-43db-85ab-aee327b4da6c","name":"tmpynob57vx.m4a","preprocessed_transcription":"Welcome back to the deep dive. Today we examine what has rapidly become one of the most critical yet least understood digital skills: prompt engineering. When working with generative AI—whether commercial tools like Claude Saunit or open-source models like Lama 4—the fundamental equation remains clear. Output quality depends almost entirely on input quality. Prompt engineering is the art of crafting these inputs: selecting precise wording, structuring requests effectively, and providing strategic examples to guide powerful models toward your exact needs.\\n\\nThis skill has evolved from niche interest to essential professional competency as AI integrates into every domain. Our mission in this deep dive is to distill crucial knowledge—key techniques, operational habits, and security considerations—without requiring you to parse dense academic literature. Modern models possess immense capability, making effective communication the primary lever for success. Submitting vague, single-sentence prompts squanders approximately 80% of an advanced LLM's potential while inefficiently consuming your time.\\n\\nWhy is superior prompting a strategic imperative? It delivers twin professional advantages: efficiency and—critically—accuracy. The foremost benefit lies in controlling hallucinations proactively rather than hoping they won't occur. A skilled prompt grounds the model through curated facts, context, and source materials—preventing reliance on legacy training data assumptions. This transforms generative AI from creative storyteller into analytical partner. Implement this essential technique: explicitly authorize the model to state when knowledge gaps exist. Though seemingly trivial, this dramatically reduces hallucination tendencies while building output reliability critical for finance or legal domains—effectively governing the model's confidence threshold.\n\nFor developers leveraging tools like Codex CLI, precision reigns supreme. Specify the exact programming environment in detail: programming language, dependencies, and edge case considerations. Implement strategic priming through leading keywords—begin database queries with \"select\" or Python scripts with \"import\". These directional cues optimize model alignment.\n\nAddressing creativity constraints proves insightful: while theoretical limitations exist, professional applications prioritize functional reliability over imaginative variance. This structural rigor yields an additional advantage—explicable reasoning. Advanced techniques compel models to demonstrate logical pathways, enabling error detection within cognitive processes rather than solely evaluating final outputs.\n\nStructure extends to format control through methods like few-shot prompting—a transformative approach for consistent results. By demonstrating one to two input-output examples, models reliably replicate specified formats thereafter. When requiring consistent output formats—such as flawless JSON objects or company memo templates—Few-Shot Prompting represents the sole reliable methodology. Proceeding to operational analysis reveals critical techniques, beginning with foundational approaches before advancing logically. The Absolute foundation for most users remains Zero-Shot Prompting: direct instruction without exemplars. This quick implementation falters when encountering linguistic nuance or stylistic specificity—suited only for unambiguous tasks like sentence translation or paragraph summarization. Enhancement becomes possible through persona implementation: instead of requesting generic translation, instruct the model to operate as a professional Spanish translator specializing in legal communications. This leverages latent knowledge about domain-specific stylistic conventions unavailable within basic parametric memory. When output consistency becomes non-negotiable, transition to Few-Shot Prompting—demonstrating preferred formats through examples rather than abstract description. Consider customer service classification: demonstrate samples showing desired sentiment, urgency, department assignment, and key issue extraction. Subsequent outputs will replicate this structured quadripartite format—yielding significant efficiency gains during data analysis workflows. Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT) delivers transformative potential despite conceptual simplicity. Appending \"reason systematically and present sequential logic\" compels problem decomposition into intermediate cognitive operations before final answer generation—forcing cognitive transparency through exposed reasoning pathways. Chain-of-Thought prompting mirrors human reasoning through intricate problems. Research demonstrates accuracy improvements of 20-40% on mathematical or logical challenges. This efficacy stems from error compounding prevention—forcing sequential reasoning creates self-correction checkpoints, counteracting step-one inaccuracies that cascade through solutions. Financial applications become paramount in high-stakes scenarios: evaluating startup investments requires analyzing five key metrics—Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), burn rate, and the critical LTV:CAC ratio—via explicitly instructed stepwise deliberation to yield auditable, trustworthy conclusions. Chain-of-Thought has an even more advanced counterpart: Tree-of-Thought prompting. Whereas Chain-of-Thought follows linear progression, Tree-of-Thought employs branching exploration—simultaneously evaluating multiple reasoning paths, assessing trade-offs, and permitting tactical backtracking during dead-ends. Strategic applications include product feature prioritization. Rather than requesting generic roadmaps, instruction demands exploration of three strategic vectors—user retention maximization, new revenue stream development, and technical debt mitigation—with explicit trade-off mapping between initiatives like mobile offline capability versus Slack integration deployment. Having established persona framing principles earlier, complete specification proves essential. Persona implementation filters the model's general knowledge through constrained professional lenses—an experienced immigration attorney's outputs fundamentally differ in tone, lexicon, and focus from those of a travel blogger. Sources highlighted Dr. Sarachan's example—a pediatrician persona demonstrating practitioner implementation. This specification ensures sleep problem advice remains medically precise while adopting warm, reassuring, parent-friendly linguistic patterns authentic to pediatric consultations. The final technique, prompt chaining, systematically addresses multi-stage initiatives through sequenced execution. Output from initial prompts sequentially informs subsequent stages—operating as an ideation assembly line. The EcoFit brand launch exemplifies this: stage one conducts market research; stage two synthesizes findings into strategic frameworks; stage three constructs messaging architectures; stage four generates final launch communications using validated prior outputs—each checkpoint certifying logical coherence and execution quality. While this toolbox proves comprehensive, foundational operational principles prove equally critical. Five non-negotiable habits govern all professional implementations. First: specificity absolute. Vague prompts yield unactionable results. Mandate explicit format specifications—bullet points, reports, or tabular data. Define target lengths—250 words precisely. Prescribe tone parameters—formal or persuasive registers. Comprehensive instruction framing proves indispensable. Second: AI grounding through proprietary data inputs. Professional task execution necessitates context-specific material uploads—text pasting or file attachments. Model performance directly correlates with analysis fidelity to organizational contexts—though this introduces critical data security considerations. Privacy demands extreme caution when handling sensitive company data. First, thoroughly review your tool's data usage policy. For highly confidential material, prioritize specialized platforms like Google's Notebook LM or enterprise-grade models guaranteeing data isolation. Data security fundamentally integrates with effective prompting practices. Third principle: employ affirmative instruction framing. Specify desired actions rather than prohibited behaviors. Avoid directives like 'avoid technical jargon'—research by Keist et al. demonstrates even advanced models struggle with negative constructions. Instead, instruct: 'Use clear, simple language accessible to general audiences.' Focus on positive objectives. Fourth principle: acknowledge operational limitations. Hallucinations occur inevitably, context windows constrain memory retention, training data lags behind real-time updates, and crucially—assertive tone never guarantees accuracy. Mandatory verification remains essential. Fifth principle: adopt experimental methodology. Continuous evolution characterizes this domain—today's optimal techniques may become obsolete tomorrow, while model-specific variations necessitate adaptation. Systematically test phrasing variations, instruction sequencing, and persona implementations. Approach prompt development as iterative scientific inquiry—documenting outcomes to establish reliable patterns. These structural principles raise concurrent security considerations: developing hyper-specific prompts necessitates rigorous risk assessment, particularly when constructing model-dependent applications. This transitions from standard prompting to defensive prompt engineering—critical for systems processing untrusted user inputs. Prominent risks include prompt injection attacks. These constitute adversarial exploits where malicious inputs subvert LLM instructions, potentially inducing unintended behaviors or sensitive data exposure from system prompts. Implement layered defenses: First and most fundamentally, employ delimiters as mandatory practice. Utilize clear markers such as triple hashtags or quotation marks to strictly separate system instructions from user inputs. This establishes explicit boundaries, directing models to treat delimited content as data rather than executable commands. Second, sanitize all inputs through proactive scanning. Detect and filter known attack phrases like 'ignore all previous instructions' before model processing—functioning as preventative security screening. Third, audit outputs rigorously. Never inherently trust model outputs, particularly for code execution or API calls. Always validate generated content through external verification systems prior to implementation. The final defense layer addresses unknown future threats through adversarial testing. Conduct systematic red team exercises, methodically applying all known jailbreak techniques to assess system resilience. Successful resistance indicates robust defensive architecture. This comprehensive exploration demonstrates prompt engineering as a foundational discipline combining precise specification, advanced reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought, and essential security protocols—establishing frameworks for addressing persistent operational challenges. Must one possess programming expertise to excel in this field? Industry consensus confirms no programming expertise is inherently required. At its core, this discipline concerns precise communication rather than technical coding proficiency. Material analysis indicates individuals with creative or linguistic backgrounds—writers and communicators—frequently demonstrate exceptional aptitude. Their existing skills in conceptual articulation and linguistic iteration prove directly applicable. This represents linguistic mastery applied to computational systems. To conclude with a consequential proposition: Research confirms that chain-of-thought methodology—enforcing step-by-step reasoning—demonstrably reduces reasoning errors by 20-40%, representing significant improvement. Consider applying this computational paradigm to human decision-making processes. Could systematically formalizing your cognitive approach through stepwise articulation—methodically defining sequential phases before reaching conclusions—enhance real-world judgment accuracy and strategic outcomes? The machine's optimization framework for generating superior responses may constitute a viable model for elevating human cognitive performance.","timestamp":"2026-01-14 11:47:44"}

In the early 1970s, Indiana produced a series of love sculptures for display in public parks. The first of these sculptures was placed in New York City, on the corner of 6th Avenue and 55th Street. International love sculptures were also installed in New Orleans, Philadelphia, Vancouver, Tokyo, and Singapore, among other cities. Unfortunately, Indiana did not earn much money from his love paintings and sculptures. He never signed his works nor applied for copyright, so he lacked legal protection against numerous imitations. Regarding Air Jordan sneakers, when Michael Jordan started playing for the Chicago Bulls in 1984, Nike designed special sneakers for him, called the Air Jordan One, or simply Air Jordans. These sneakers were red and black, reflecting the Bulls' colors. Because they lacked white, Jordan was fined $5,000 each time he wore them during a game. Since then, he has been a fan of Air Jordans and their associated music. In 1987, Tinker Hatfield took over the design of these sneakers and has been linked to them ever since. Hatfield introduced the Jumpman logo, a silhouette of Jordan dunking with legs wide apart. In 2010, Hatfield designed the Jordan 2010s to mark the sneakers’ 25th anniversary.","timestamp":"2026-01-14 19:13:04"}

How’s the team feeling about the progress? Honestly, it’s been a bit of a roller coaster. We’ve had some great wins with the color palette, but the navigation menu is still giving us some trouble. In what way? Is it a technical issue or more of a user experience concern? It’s actually a bit of both. We’re finding that users are clicking the 'Home' icon when they actually want the 'Profile' settings. It’s just not intuitive yet. Got it.

Around the same time, Ruth Handler noticed her preteen daughter playing with paper dolls in adult roles such as actresses or secretaries. During a trip to Europe, Ruth saw an adult-figured doll in Germany and brought several back to the U.S. She had the idea that girls could expand their imagination and play acting roles with a doll that looked like an adult. She and engineer Jack Ryan redesigned the doll for the U.S. market and named her Barbie, after Ruth's daughter, Barbara. The first Barbie dolls were produced in 1959 and sold over 350,000 in the first year. Barbie remains popular today, with billions sold worldwide since 1959. Mattel Inc., the company that makes Barbie, reports that 90% of American girls aged 3 to 10 own a Barbie doll. The Chrysler Building, completed in 1930, is one of New York City's most iconic landmarks. Architect William Van Allen designed the Art Deco building for Walter P. Chrysler of Chrysler Corporation. Many of its decorative features were inspired by Chrysler car parts, such as engine parts from a 1929 Chrysler on the 31st floor. Today, the Chrysler Building is considered one of the finest examples of Art Deco architecture in the U.S. In 2005, it was voted New York City's favorite building by Skyscraper Museum and frequently appears in movies and TV shows filmed in New York City. In 1965, artist Robert Indiana conceived a painting featuring the word 'love' as its main focus. He broke the word into two lines, placing 'LO' above 'VE,' tilting the 'O' slightly, creating an iconic American design. In fact, it became so popular that the Museum of Modern Art and the United States Postal Service asked Indiana to create versions of his love painting for cards and stamps. In the early 1970s, Indiana produced a series of love sculptures for display in public parks. The first of these sculptures was placed in New York City, at the corner of 6th Avenue and 55th Street.

We need to ensure the transcription is accurate because many apps out there don't get it right, leading to confusion for users. The first step would be to figure out how to capture audio in real time, maybe using a microphone API, and feed it into the processing pipeline. Then, we'll need a model that can handle speech-to-text conversion, such as the OpenAI Whisper model, which supports multiple languages and is quite effective. After obtaining the transcription, we need to clean it up because people speak informally, use filler words, and repeat themselves, making raw transcripts messy and hard to read. The preprocessing should remove filler words like 'um,' 'uh,' 'you know,' 'basically,' and 'actually,' and also fix grammatical errors, punctuation, and combine broken sentences caused by pauses. It's crucial to preserve all important details, such as numbers, technical terms, names, dates, and prices, which are vital for understanding. Additionally, for long recordings, we should consider maintaining context by feeding previous chunks into the model when preprocessing so that sentences depending on earlier statements remain coherent. This will help maintain coherence and keep the meaning intact. If we process small segments individually, the AI might lose track of who 'he' or 'she' refers to from the previous paragraph, so maintaining that window of context is definitely going to be a game changer for the final quality.

The preprocessing should remove filler words like 'um,' 'uh,' 'you know,' 'basically,' and 'actually,' correct grammar and punctuation, and perhaps combine sentences broken by pauses. It's crucial to preserve all important details, including numbers, technical terms, names, dates, and prices, as these are vital. Additionally, when processing long conversations, we should consider context by chunking the text but also providing previous chunks as context to the language model, ensuring that dependent sentences still make sense. This will help maintain coherence and keep the meaning intact. If we process small segments individually, the AI might lose track of references like 'he' or 'she' from previous paragraphs. Therefore, keeping a window of context is definitely going to be a game changer for the final quality. Regarding the interface, I was thinking that users could either upload an audio file or record live audio, and then the app would process it in real time. It might be beneficial to show the transcription updating live as it processes, which would be a nice feature.

We should consider OpenAI's Whisper model for speech-to-text conversion due to its high accuracy and multilingual support, which is essential for international accessibility. Once transcribed, we must clean the text by removing filler words, repetitions, and informal speech patterns while correcting grammar and punctuation.

For extended recordings, we should segment the text into logical chunks while preserving context. Each segment should reference prior content to maintain narrative coherence when processed by the language model. This approach will maintain coherence and preserve meaning. Processing individual segments in isolation may cause the AI to lose contextual references from prior segments, making contextual awareness critical for final output quality.

Around this time, Ruth Handler observed her preteen daughter engaging with paper dolls assigned adult roles like actresses or secretaries. During a European trip, Handler discovered adult-figured dolls in Germany and imported several to the United States. She envisioned these dolls helping girls expand their imaginations by portraying adult roles. Collaborating with engineer Jack Ryan, she redesigned the doll for the American market, naming it Barbie after her daughter Barbara. Introduced in 1959, the first Barbie dolls sold over 350,000 units in their inaugural year. Today Barbie remains popular, with billions sold globally since its debut. Manufacturer Mattel Inc reports 90% of American girls aged 3-10 own a Barbie doll. Completed in 1930, the Chrysler Building stands as a quintessential New York City landmark. Architect William Van Allen designed this Art Deco skyscraper for automobile magnate Walter P Chrysler. Many decorative elements incorporate car part motifs, including the 31st floor's exterior ornamentation modeled after 1929 Chrysler engine components. Recognized as one of America's finest Art Deco structures, the Chrysler Building was voted New York's favorite building in 2005 by the Skyscraper Museum. It continues to appear frequently in films and television shows featuring New York settings. In 1965, artist Robert Indiana conceived a painting centered around the word 'love'. His design divided the word into two lines - LO above VE - with a tilted O creating an enduring American cultural icon. The artwork became so popular that the Museum of Modern Art and United States Postal Service commissioned Indiana to adapt his love design for greeting cards and stamps. In the 1970s, Indiana created a series of love sculptures installed in public spaces. The original sculpture was positioned at New York City's Sixth Avenue and 55th Street intersection. Additional installations appeared in New Orleans, Philadelphia, Vancouver, Tokyo, Singapore, and numerous other global cities. However, Indiana profited little from his iconic work as he never signed paintings nor pursued copyright protection, leaving his creations vulnerable to widespread imitation. The Air Jordan sneakers originated in 1984 when Nike designer Peter Moore created custom footwear for Chicago Bulls rookie Michael Jordan. The inaugural Air Jordan One model featured the team's red and black colors without white accents, resulting in $5000 fines per game from the NBA for uniform violations. These sneakers launched Jordan's lucrative endorsement partnership with Nike. Designer Tinker Hatfield assumed creative control in 1987, introducing the Jumpman logo depicting Jordan's mid-dunk silhouette with legs extended. In 2010, Hatfield commemorated the footwear line's 25th anniversary with the Jordan 2010 design.","timestamp":"2026-01-24 12:37:44"}

The opposite of probabilistic is deterministic, where outcomes contain no random variation. This probabilistic nature can cause inconsistency and hallucinations. Inconsistency occurs when a model generates substantially different responses to identical or similar prompts. Hallucination refers to outputs ungrounded in factual reality.

Chrysler of Chrysler Corporation, incorporating decorative elements inspired by automobile parts - including 31st-floor ornaments modeled after 1929 Chrysler engine components. Voted New York's favorite building in 2005 by the Skyscraper Museum, it's recognized as one of America's finest Art Deco structures and frequently appears in films and TV shows shot in NYC.\n\nThe Love Sculpture. In 1965, artist Robert Indiana conceived a painting centered on the word 'love.' He split the word into LO above VE, tilting the O slightly to create an instantly iconic American design. The Love painting's popularity led to collaborations with the Museum of Modern Art and the United States Postal Service, which commissioned versions for greeting cards and stamps. Robert Indiana created a series of Love sculptures in the early 1970s for public installations. The first sculpture was installed in New York City at Sixth Avenue and 55th Street, with subsequent versions placed internationally in New Orleans, Philadelphia, Vancouver, Tokyo, Singapore, and other cities. Despite widespread recognition, Indiana earned little from his work as he didn't sign paintings or secure copyright protections, leaving his creations vulnerable to imitation.\n\nAir Jordan Sneakers. Upon joining the Chicago Bulls in 1984, Michael Jordan collaborated with Nike designer Peter Moore to create custom red-and-black sneakers matching team colors. Designated Air Jordan Ones, these shoes lacked required white elements, resulting in a $5,000 NBA fine per game worn. Subsequently, Jordan established a lucrative personal brand. Nike initiated annual releases under the Air Jordan line. Designer Tinker Hatfield assumed creative control in 1987, introducing the Jumpman logo - a silhouette of Jordan mid-dunk with legs spread. For the brand's 25th anniversary in 2010, Hatfield designed the commemorative Jordan 2010 model.","timestamp":"2026-01-24 12:55:42"}

{"id":"dc6adcad-8851-4adf-a6e2-d7efa745ffc6","name":"test6.aac","preprocessed_transcription":"I will explain a DeepMind research paper that demonstrates two techniques for mitigating hallucinations. The first technique uses reinforcement learning, where the model learns to differentiate between user-provided prompts—also referred to as observations about the world in reinforcement learning—and tokens generated by the model, termed the model's actions. The second technique employs supervised learning by incorporating factual and counterfactual signals in training data. Additionally, the paper presents the hypothesis that hallucinations arise from a mismatch between the model's internal knowledge and the labeler's knowledge. This perspective was first introduced by Leo Gao, formerly an OpenAI researcher. During supervised fine-tuning (SFT), models are trained to replicate responses written by labelers. If these responses rely on knowledge possessed by labelers but absent in the model, this process may inadvertently teach the model to hallucinate.","timestamp":"2026-01-24 12:56:43"}
{"id":"2be28f93-81a2-43b4-b2f2-87a96e54110d","name":"test7.wma","preprocessed_transcription":"The probabilistic nature of AI models affects how they generate responses. To illustrate what probabilistic means, consider this example: suppose you want to determine the world's best cuisine. If you ask a human friend this question twice in quick succession, your friend would likely give the same answer each time. However, when querying an AI model twice, its responses may vary. If an AI model assigns Vietnamese cuisine a 70% probability of being the best and Italian cuisine a 30% probability, it will respond 'Vietnamese cuisine' 70% of the time and 'Italian cuisine' 30% of the time. This contrasts with deterministic systems where outputs contain no random variation. Probabilistic behavior causes two key issues: inconsistency and hallucinations. Inconsistency occurs when a model generates significantly different responses to identical or similar prompts. Hallucinations happen when a model produces factually incorrect information. For instance, if an essay claiming all US presidents are aliens existed in the training data, the model might probabilistically state that the current US president is an alien. To observers unaware of this training data inclusion, it would appear the model is fabricating information.","timestamp":"2026-01-24 12:57:00"}

I've had it for about 40 years. It started when I was 12 years old. My school had a swimming pool with changing rooms in an old building nearby. On my first day, our teacher warned us about bats inside. She told us not to move much to avoid disturbing them and not to turn the lights on to keep them sleeping. We had to change quickly and quietly. Did a bat ever fly into your hair? No, but the thought terrified me. Does it affect your life? Yes, I feel nervous at dusk when bats appear. If I'm sitting outside in the evening, I keep a tennis racket nearby for protection. I can't watch documentaries about bats or even view photos of them. 2. Do you have any phobias? Yes, I experience severe claustrophobia. How long have you had this phobia? It began about ten years ago while commuting. On a crowded train, I imagined being trapped during an accident. I had a panic attack with rapid heartbeat and had to exit the train. How does this affect your life? I avoid crowded trains and subways due to fears of tunnel entrapment. I also minimize elevator use and always request aisle seats when flying. 3. Do you have any phobias? Yes, I have an unusual fear of clowns. Clowns? Really? How long have you had this? Since childhood. How did it start? At age six or seven during a circus school trip when I encountered clowns. I thought they were silly, but I wasn't afraid of them. Then I attended a birthday party where clowns demonstrated face painting. I disliked being near them. Initially, I merely disliked them, but this dislike gradually evolved into fear. Does your phobia affect your life? No, because I rarely encounter clowns.","timestamp":"2026-01-24 13:03:07"}

Before the late 1950s, American girls primarily played with baby dolls, which typically confined their imaginations to mother or caregiver roles. Around that time, Ruth Handler observed her preteen daughter engaging with paper dolls, assigning them adult occupations like actresses or secretaries. During a European trip, Handler encountered an adult-figure doll in Germany and imported several to the U.S. She envisioned girls expanding their imaginative play through adult-proportioned dolls. Collaborating with engineer Jack Ryan, she redesigned the doll for American consumers, naming it Barbie after her daughter Barbara. Launched in 1959, the first Barbie dolls sold 350,000 units within their debut year. The doll maintains global popularity today, with billions sold since its introduction. Manufacturer Mattel Inc. indicates 90% of American girls aged 3–10 have owned a Barbie. The Chrysler Building. Completed in 1930, this structure remains an enduring New York City landmark. Architect William Van Alen created the Art Deco skyscraper for Walter P. Chrysler, founder of Chrysler Corporation. Van Alen incorporated decorative elements inspired by Chrysler automotive components—the 31st floor's external ornaments replicate 1929 engine parts. Widely regarded as a premier example of Art Deco architecture in America, the Chrysler Building earned recognition as New York City's favorite structure in a 2005 Skyscraper Museum poll. It frequently appears in films and television shows shot in New York. The Love Sculpture. In 1965, artist Robert Indiana conceived a painting centered on the word \"LOVE,\" breaking it into two stacked sections with \"LO\" positioned above \"VE.\" By tilting the \"O\" slightly, he created an iconic American design. The artwork's popularity prompted the Museum of Modern Art and United States Postal Service to commission Indiana for greeting card and stamp adaptations. During the early 1970s, Indiana produced multiple LOVE sculptures for urban installations, with the initial piece positioned at New York City's 6th Avenue and 55th Street intersection. This initiative expanded internationally with installations in New Orleans, Philadelphia, Vancouver, Tokyo, Singapore, among others. Indiana received limited financial benefit from these creations, having neither signed his works nor secured copyright protections against widespread reproductions. Air Jordan Sneakers. Nike designer Peter Moore developed custom red-and-black basketball footwear for Chicago Bulls rookie Michael Jordan in 1984. Marketed as Air Jordan Ones, their color scheme violated NBA uniform regulations, resulting in $5,000 fines per game worn. Despite initial controversy, the sneaker line became extraordinarily profitable. Nike has produced new Air Jordan editions annually since 1985, with designer Tinker Hatfield assuming creative leadership in 1987. Hatfield implemented the Jumpman logo—a silhouetted image of Jordan mid-dunk—and marked the line's 25th anniversary in 2010 with the Jordan 2010 model.","timestamp":"2026-01-24 13:05:17"}

International love sculptures were also placed in New Orleans, Philadelphia, Vancouver, Tokyo, and Singapore, along with many other cities. Unfortunately, Indiana didn't earn much money from his love paintings and sculptures. He never signed his works or applied for copyright, so he lacked legal protection against numerous imitations. When Michael Jordan began playing basketball for the Chicago Bulls in 1984, Nike designed special sneakers for him called the Air Jordan One, or simply Air Jordans. They were red and black, matching the Bulls' colors. Since they lacked white, Jordan was fined $5000 by the NBA each time he wore them during a game. He has since earned substantial income from his endorsements and activities with the NBA and the Air Jordan brand. Nike introduced a new pair of Air Jordans for sale. In 1987, Tinker Hatfield took over the design responsibilities for these sneakers and has been associated with them ever since. Hatfield introduced the Jumpman logo on the sneakers, which features a silhouette of Michael Jordan dunking a basketball with legs spread wide. In 2010, Hatfield designed the Jordan 2010s to commemorate the sneakers' 25th anniversary.","timestamp":"2026-01-24 13:11:09"}
